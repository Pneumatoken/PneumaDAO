			<p>Pneuma DAICO </p>
			<p>Distributed Autonomous Corporations (DAC) operates regardless of any human involvement under the control of an incorruptible set of business rules, codified in distributed and autonomous ethereum smart contracts. These rules are implemented as publicly auditable open source software distributed across the computers of their stakeholders. You become a stakeholder by buying “stock” in the company or being paid in that stock to provide services for the company. This stock may entitle you to a share of its “profits”, participation in its growth, and/or a say in how it is run. </p>
			<p>mentioned the son of DAO attack. You should make a crypto version of Robert Conquest's three laws of politics and Pournelle's Iron Law of Bureaucracy.</p>
