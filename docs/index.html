These smart contracts implement rules via a publicly auditable open source software, distributed across stakeholder's devices. You become a stakeholder by buying “coins” in the organization or being paid in that coin to provide goods and services for the organization. This coin may entitle you to a share of its “profits”, participation in its growth, and/or a say in how it is run. using a self sovereign identity system</p>
			<p>mentioned lessons learned from the "son of DAO" attack. demonstrate Code prohibiting a crypto version of Robert Conquest's three laws of politics and Pournelle's Iron Law of Bureaucracy.</p>
